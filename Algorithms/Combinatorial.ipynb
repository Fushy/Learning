    "# Combinatorial algorithm\n",
    "A combinatorial algorithm is a mathematical method used to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable parts. The basic idea behind a combinatorial algorithm is to take a large, complex problem and divide it into a series of smaller, simpler sub-problems, which can be solved independently. The results of these sub-problems are then combined to give the final solution to the original problem."
